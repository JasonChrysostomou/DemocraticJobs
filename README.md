## Goals
The goals of the site are to:

1. Make it easy for job seekers to find job opportunities at worker cooperatives. 
2. Increase the exposure of job listings and help worker cooperatives attract more relevant candidates.
3. Promote worker cooperatives and the democratic economy.

## Description
A successful pilot site was launched in 2019, which had over 100 jobs posted and 14,000 visitors. However, jobs were required to be manually posted. The vision is to build the next version of the site as an aggregator which pulls jobs from the career pages of worker cooperative websites automatically into the jobs board using a standardised data format, see [Job Posting Schema](https://schema.org/JobPosting).
